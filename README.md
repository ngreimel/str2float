# str2float

## Setup
This is a coding exercise written in PHP to refactor the `str2float()`
function. The method accepts a string and returns a string formatted with
two decimal places.

> **Review and rewrite this function in a more direct, easier to understand,
and precise manner.**

In the project directory, run
```
composer install
```

To run the test suite, run
```
composer test
```

## Bonus
The current implementation has at least 2 identified bugs. Fix and test using 
```
composer test-bug1
composer test-bug2
composer test-all
```
